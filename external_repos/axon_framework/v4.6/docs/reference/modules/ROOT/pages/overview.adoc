= High-level overview

The purpose of Axon Framework is to help software developers design and build solutions according to well-established principles and best practices. To understand the framework, one first needs to understand what solutions made with it look like.

== Typical solution

Here is a somewhat simplified structure of a typical Axon-based application.

TIP: If you want to build _(or merely explore)_ a simple example of such an application, the xref:giftcard::index.adoc[] will guide you through the process.


=== The benefits

Note the following aspects in the <<axon-arch-diagram>> above:

 - Distinct parts communicate with each other via messages. Thus the communication pattern is the same regardless of whether components reside in the same deployment unit or multiple distributed ones.
 - The command and query sides (models) are separated as described by xref:concepts::cqrs.adoc[CQRS]. Each side can scale and evolve independently.
 - Since the command model is independent, developers and domain experts can establish a ubiquitous language and design it following the xref:concepts::ddd.adoc[Domain-Driven Design] principles.
 - As the repository of the command model is independent, and all state changes result in events, the solution can benefit from xref:concepts::es.adoc[Event Sourcing] and store all changes instead of limiting itself to the latest state.

Constructing applications in such a way makes it possible to

 - follow closely and adequately map the actual domain
 - discuss with domain experts and reason about the impact of any change
 - postpone deployment decisions until all relevant knowledge is available
 - scale out individual components as needed

=== The Axon Framework's role

Building such a solution from scratch is a challenging and time-consuming task. Designing and implementing the infrastructure, communication, common abstractions, etc., introduces significant overhead.

Axon Framework removes that overhead by providing pre-ready components that take care of the `messaging`, `modeling`, and `event sourcing` parts.


== Structure

Axon Framework consists of several modules packaged and distributed as JAR files. This approach allows developers to pick and choose the functionality they need.

=== Bootstrap Modules

Those are the modules that allow bootstrapping and configuring an Axon-based application. The application should include the preferred option as a dependency.

xref:#[Configuration]::
This module contains all the necessary components to configure an Axon-based application manually. It does not depend on any third party frameworks.

xref:#[Spring Boot Starter]::
This module provides Spring Boot auto-configuration for the application. It depends on Spring Framework to automatically configure all Axon Framework components.


=== Core Modules

The core modules provide the essential components and building blocks for any Axon-based application.

xref:messaging:index.adoc[Messaging]::
This module provides the elements needed to build proper messaging. That includes message busses and gateways, message lifecycle and scopes, correlation, serialization and deserialization, error handling, retries, etc.

xref:modeling:index.adoc[Modeling]::
This module contains the components needed to build proper domain models on the command side. Most notably, it supports modeling essential Command-Handling Component types such as Aggregates and Sagas.

xref:eventsourcing:index.adoc[Event Sourcing]::
This module contains the components needed to provide an Event Sourcing implementation of the Command model repository.

NOTE: A typical Axon-based application will almost always depend on all core modules. However, there is usually no need to declare them as dependencies explicitly. The preferred bootstrap module will provide them as transitive ones.



=== Optional Modules

xref:#[Spring]::
This module allows developers to configure Axon Framework components in a Spring Application context. It also provides several implementations specific to Spring Framework, such as an adapter for publishing and retrieving Axon Events on a Spring Messaging Channel.

xref:#[Axon Server Connector]::
This module provides infrastructure components that connect to Axon Server.

xref:#[Test]::
This module contains test fixtures that developers can use to test Axon-based components, such as Command Handlers, Aggregates, and Sagas. Typically one does not need this module at runtime and will only add it to the classpath for running tests.

xref:#[Disruptor]::
This module contains a specific CommandBus and Command Handling solution based on the Disruptor paradigm.

xref:#[Metrics]::
This module provides basic implementations based on Coda Hale to collect the monitoring information.

xref:#[Micrometer]::
This module provides basic implementations based on Micrometer to collect the monitoring information. It is a dimensional-first metrics collection facade aiming to allow developers to time, count, and gauge their code with a vendor-neutral API.

xref:#[Legacy]::
This module contains components that enable the migration of older Axon projects to use the latest Axon version.

xref:#[Tracing OpenTelemetry]::
This module contains the components needed to enable tracing with OpenTelemetry.
