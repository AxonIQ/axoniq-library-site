Please take some time to learn about the system if this is the first time you have encountered it. The site linked above provides a concise yet complete description and some examples. Figure 1. The documentation types quadrant As you can see in the above image, there are four types of documentation materials: tutorials, how-to guides, technical references, and explanations. They represent four different purposes or functions and require four different approaches to their creation. The following table (copied from the website linked above) summarizes how those differ. Table 1. The main differences between the four types Tutorials How-to guides References Explanations oriented to learning a goal information understanding must allow the newcomer to get started show how to solve a specific problem describe the machinery explain its form a lesson a series of steps dry description discursive explanation analogy teaching a small child how to cook a recipe in a cookery book a reference encyclopedia article an article on culinary social history When writing documentation, always consider who’s the reader and what’s the goal. Don’t try to produce \"one documentation serves them all\" solutions. Even when documenting the same product, split the information into different learning materials to help the readers focus on their goals. If you feel the reader would benefit from more information that doesn’t fit the given documentation format, provide links to a relevant place in a different learning material. These materials take the reader by the hand and help them complete a project of some kind. The goal is to show a beginner they can achieve something with it. It doesn’t have too detailed or exhaustive. There may be more (and even better) ways to achieve the same result. The following are some examples of content that you should write as tutorials. Building a Giftcard application Walks the reader through creating a somewhat simple application. Axon Synapse quick start guide Walks the reader through the basics of using Axon Synapse Axon Server installation guide Basic instructions on how to run Axon Server on-premises, in Docker, and on the Cloud. These are recipes and directions to achieve a specific end. The goal is to have a working, complete, and correct solution at the end. Those are different from tutorials and must be distinct. A tutorial is what a beginner needs to know. A how-to guide answers a question only a user with some experience could formulate. The following are some examples of content that you should write as how-to guides. How to integrate Axon Framework with Detailed instructions from zero to a working integration. How to run Axon Server on AWS Detailed instructions on how to run Axon Server on AWS infrastructure. AxonIQ Cloud How-Tos A collection of mini how-to materials explaining how to achieve certain goals (transfer an account, configure segments, …​) via the UI. These are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. The goal is to understand how something works, what problem it solves, the design considerations, etc. Naturally, a reference must use some examples to demonstrate intended usage. However, it’s not a tutorial or a how-to guide. The following are some examples of content that you should write as references. Axon Framework reference documentation Detailed information on the internals of the framework, its design considerations, and intended usage. Axon Server reference documentation Detailed information on the APIs (gRPC, REST, …​) used to communicate with the server. Axon Synapse reference documentation Detailed information on the endpoints, their purpose, supported encodings and payload types, required vs. optional request parameters and headers, etc. These provide explanations and clarify and illuminate a particular topic. The goal is to provide background and broader context. The following are some examples of contents that you should write as explanations. Software development concepts An overview of the essential software development concepts the products depend upon. It highlights the most important, relevant, and not-relevant parts. What is Axon Explanation of the term, how it differs from the many \"Axon-\" products, and when it’s correct to use it.","title":"Documentation System","component":"meta","version":"master","name":"doc-system","url":"/meta/design/doc-system.html","titles":[{"text":"There isn’t one thing called documentation","hash":"_there_isnt_one_thing_called_documentation","id":1},{"text":"Applying the system in AxonIQ Library","hash":"_applying_the_system_in_axoniq_library","id":2},{"text":"Tutorials","hash":"_tutorials","id":3},{"text":"How-to guides","hash":"_how_to_guides","id":4},{"text":"References","hash":"_references","id":5},{"text":"Explanations","hash":"_explanations","id":6}]},"13":{"id":13,"text":"Below are the steps to aggregate all content from all sources and produce the final static website for AxonIQ Library. Install Antora by following the instructions relevant to your system. Install Vale by following the instructions relevant to your system. Start by cloning the AxonIQ library repository using your favorite Git client. A command line, as the one below, works too. $ git clone git@github.com:AxonIQ/axoniq-library-site.git You can give the local folder whatever name you wish, but this document refers to it as axoniq-library-site. The code in this project is responsible for generating the AxonIQ Library website. What content the site generator includes and where it gets it from depends on the playbook file used. In the codebase, there are two playbooks: playbook.yaml - this is the production build playbook playbook-dev.yaml - this is the playbook configured for building a local development version of the site You shouldn’t need to change any of those files. In the rare cases when you may need to, change both accordingly to ensure identical results in both environments. The prose linter uses rules from third parties distributed via Vale’s Package Hub. To install those packages, run the following command in the axoniq-library-site folder. $ vale sync You can build AxonIQ Library locally with the production configuration to ensure you have all the tooling in place and properly configured. To do so, go to the axoniq-library-site folder and run the following command. $ npx antora playbook.yaml The above uses the playbook.yaml, where the locations of the content sources are remote Git repositories. Therefore the build may take a while as the site generator needs to fetch all remote repositories containing content sources. Some of the content sources are private repositories that need authentication. You likely only have access to those if you are an AxonIQ employee or a trusted collaborator. If you aren’t, you can still build most of the AxonIQ Library locally by making a copy of playbook.yaml and removing all the private content sources. If you are a member of the AxonIQ Organization on GitHub, you must grant the build tool access to private repositories. To do so, you must create a Personal Access Token (PAT). log in to GitHub go to Settings Developer settings Personal access tokens Fine-grained personal access tokens page and create a new PAT in Resource owner select AxonIQ in Repository access select All repositories in Repository permissions select read-only access to Contents and Metadata save the PAT and wait for AxonIQ Organizations admins to approve it Then you need to configure Git to use the PAT. Create or edit the ~/.git-credentials file and add the following line https://:@github.com Replace with your user name and with the full PAT you created (starting with github_pat_). With that in place, you can fetch content from private repositories and build the AxonIQ Library locally from the production playbook. For alternative ways to configure access to content sources, check Antora’s Private Repository Authentication page In the playbook-dev.yaml, the locations of the content sources are the local Git clones of the respective projects. Thus users need to configure the correct locations for their local machines. The configuration relies on symlinks in a dedicated folder named localLinks. This way, playbook-dev.yaml doesn’t need to change per user. When you first clone the repository, the axoniq-library-site/localLinks folder should be empty. You need to create the respective symlinks to the local Git clones of the projects containing content sources. It’s best to explain with an example. Consider the following fragment from playbook-dev.yaml. - url: . start_paths: ['localLinks/AxonFramework/docs/*', '!localLinks/AxonFramework/docs/playbook'] The site builder thus expects all folders under axoniq-library-site/localLinks/AxonFramework/docs except axoniq-library-site/localLinks/AxonFramework/docs/playbook to be content sources. Let’s assume your local Git clone of Axon Framework is in the ~/work/axon-framework/ folder. Thus the actual path to the content sources on your machine is ~/work/axon-framework/docs. To satisfy the site builder’s expectations, you must create a symlink axoniq-library-site/localLinks/AxonFramework that points to ~/work/axon-framework/. You can do so on Linux and Mac OS with the following command. $ cd axoniq-library-site/localLinks $ ln -s ~/work/axon-framework/ AxonFramework It’s possible that you don’t have local clones of all repositories containing content sources. If you want to avoid cloning more projects than you work on, you can create a custom playbook and mix the content sources configuration. The process is simple. make a copy of playbook-dev.yaml. For this document, let’s assume the new name is my-playbook.yaml add my-playbook.yaml to .gitignore create the symlinks for the repositories you have local clones edit the sources section of my-playbook.yaml and replace each entry for which you don’t have a local clone with the equivalent from the playbook.yaml file The following fragment shows a mixed configuration. - url: . start_paths: ['localLinks/AxonFramework/docs/*', '!localLinks/AxonFramework/docs/playbook'] - url: https://github.com/AxonIQ/giftcard-demo.git start_paths: ['docs/*', '!docs/playbook'] In this playbook, Axon Framework’s content sources come from a local clone, while the giftcard-demo project’s content sources come from a remote repository. When you use a custom playbook outside version control, you must monitor playbook-dev.yaml and manually apply any changes to your custom playbook. To build AxonIQ Library locally with the development configuration, go to the axoniq-library-site folder and run Antora with the desired playbook. $ npx antora playbook-dev.yaml The above uses the playbook-dev.yaml. You can, of course, use my-playbook.yaml or any other instead. Antora generates a static site in axoniq-library-site/build/site folder. It doesn’t have a web server to run the site on localhost. You may access it from your browser via the file:// protocol, but some links may not work. You must have a web server running on your machine to access the site on a URL like http://localhost:8080. You can use any of the popular solutions available on your operating system. You can also start a simple web server from the axoniq-library-site/build/site folder in several different ways. Below are some examples. Using Python to serve AxonIQ Library on localhost:8080 python3 -m http.server 8080 Using NodeJS to serve AxonIQ Library on localhost:8080 npm install -g http-server http-server -p 8080 Using PHP to serve AxonIQ Library on localhost:8080 php -S localhost:8080","title":"Build AxonIQ Library","component":"meta","version":"master","name":"build","url":"/meta/overview/build.html","titles":[{"text":"Install required tools","hash":"_install_required_tools","id":1},{"text":"Get the website source code","hash":"_get_the_website_source_code","id":2},{"text":"Install Vale packages","hash":"_install_vale_packages","id":3},{"text":"Build with production configuration","hash":"_build_with_production_configuration","id":4},{"text":"Access to private repositories","hash":"_access_to_private_repositories","id":5},{"text":"Build with local development configuration","hash":"_build_with_local_development_configuration","id":6},{"text":"Configure content sources","hash":"_configure_content_sources","id":7},{"text":"Mixing content sources","hash":"_mixing_content_sources","id":8},{"text":"Build","hash":"_build","id":9},{"text":"Run AxonIQ Library locally","hash":"_run_axoniq_library_locally","id":10}]},"14":{"id":14,"text":"Content sources are the locations where the site builder finds the content to include in the website.

Every folder under the content folder is a content source as specified by the following configuration in playbook.yaml and playbook-dev.yaml files. - url: . start_paths: content/* Each project manages its own set of content sources. By convention, the location for those is the docs folder in the root of the three. The exception is the docs/_playbook folder which contains the playbooks to build the project’s documentation independently of AxonIQ Library. For every such project, there is a respective entry in the playbooks. The example below shows the record for Axon Framework in playbook-dev.yaml. - url: . start_paths: ['localLinks/AxonFramework/docs/*', '!localLinks/AxonFramework/docs/_playbook'] The project’s content sources must follow the tree structure, rules, and conventions.

Follow the folder structure from any existing content source, configure the antora.yml accordingly, and add content to the pages folder in the desired modules. If AxonIQ Library’s playbook already contains an entry for the project, the rule is identical to the one for generic content sources. Create a new folder in the project’s docs folder, recreate the expected folder structure, configure the antora.yml file accordingly, and start adding content. If the project is not yet in AxonIQ Library’s playbook, you must add it. You must edit both playbook.yaml and playbook-dev.yaml files and add the respective entries specifying the project’s Git repository location. For playbook-dev.yaml, you must add something like the following. - url: . start_paths: ['localLinks/ProjectName/docs/*', '!localLinks/ProjectName/docs/_playbook'] Then create a symlink from localLinks/ProjectName to the folder with your local clone of that repository.

Then, adding to the command handler: @CommandHandler public void handle(RedeemCardCommand command, DeadlineManager deadlineManager) { //check validity apply(new CardRedeemedEvent(giftCardId, command.amount())); if (remainingValue == 0) { deadlineManager.cancelAllWithinScope(EXPIRED_GIFT_CARD); (1) } } 1 This call cancels all deadlines with the name EXPIRED_GIFT_CARD for this aggregate instance. It’s possible to use the return value from scheduling a deadline to cancel a specific deadline. In this case, there can be at most one deadline scheduled with this name, so this is easier. And the event sourcing handler: @EventSourcingHandler public void on(CardRedeemedEvent event) { remainingValue -= event.amount(); } A test to make sure the deadline is cancelled: @Test void testCardNotExpiringIfNothingLeft() { testFixture.givenNoPriorActivity() .andGivenCommands( new IssueExpiringCardCommand(CARD_ID, DAYS, AMOUNT), new RedeemCardCommand(CARD_ID, AMOUNT) ) .whenTimeElapses(Duration.ofDays(31L)) .expectSuccessfulHandlerExecution() .expectNoEvents(); } This should help get you started with deadlines.

If you are new to DDD, CQRS, or Event Sourcing, consider reading the \"Software Development Concepts\" first. Axon Framework alone significantly simplifies the software development process of JVM-based applications following the above principles. However, it adds even more value when used in combination with other products of the Axon family. To understand the bigger picture, please refer to \"Understanding Axon\". It explains how individual products complement each other and work together towards a common goal. The reference documentation is a valuable source during the development process. It assumes the reader is familiar with the underlying software design principles, deployment architectures, etc. To learn more about those, please refer to the relevant Explanations. For step-by-step instructions and examples of how to build Axon-based applications, use the Tutorials. For solving known challenges and completing typical tasks, there are How-To Guides. The reference documentation aims to document the specifics of the framework’s functionality, objects, interfaces, etc. It’s a convenient, quick-access reference answering questions like \"What’s X?\", \"What’s X used for?\", \"How’s X implemented?\" etc. Thus it closely follows the structure of Axon Framework’s source code.

Figure 1. high-level application architecture If you want to build (or merely explore) a simple example of such an application, the Building a Giftcard Application tutorial walks you through the process. Note the following aspects in the high-level application architecture above: Distinct parts communicate with each other via messages. Thus the communication pattern is the same regardless of whether components reside in the same deployment unit or multiple distributed ones. There is clear separation between the command and the query sides (models) as described by CQRS. Each side can scale and evolve independently. Since the command model is independent, developers and domain experts can establish a ubiquitous language and design it following the Domain-Driven Design principles. As the repository of the command model is independent, and all state changes result in events, the solution can benefit from Event Sourcing and store all changes instead of limiting itself to the latest state. Constructing applications in such a way makes it possible to follow closely and adequately map the actual domain discuss with domain experts and reason about the impact of any change postpone deployment decisions until all relevant knowledge is available scale out individual components as needed Building such a solution from scratch is a challenging and time-consuming task. Designing and implementing the infrastructure, communication, common abstractions, etc., introduces significant overhead.

It doesn’t depend on any third party frameworks. Spring Boot Starter Module This module provides Spring Boot auto-configuration for the application. It depends on Spring Framework to automatically configure all Axon Framework components. The core modules provide the essential components and building blocks for any Axon-based application. Messaging Module This module provides the elements needed to build proper messaging. That includes message busses and gateways, message lifecycle and scopes, correlation, serialization and deserialization, error handling, retries, etc. Modeling Module This module contains the components needed to build proper domain models on the command side. Most notably, it supports modeling essential Command-Handling Component types such as Aggregates and Sagas. Event Sourcing Module This module contains the components needed to provide an Event Sourcing implementation of the Command model repository. A typical Axon-based application almost always depends on all core modules. However, there is usually no need to declare them as dependencies explicitly. The preferred bootstrap module provides them as transitive ones. Spring Module This module allows developers to configure Axon Framework components in a Spring Application context. It also provides several implementations specific to Spring Framework, such as an adapter for publishing and retrieving Axon Events on a Spring Messaging Channel. Axon Server Connector Module This module provides infrastructure components that connect to Axon Server. Test Module This module contains test fixtures that developers can use to test Axon-based components, such as Command Handlers, Aggregates, and Sagas. Typically one doesn’t need this module at runtime and only adds it to the classpath for running tests. Disruptor Module This module contains a specific CommandBus and Command Handling solution based on the Disruptor paradigm. Metrics Module This module provides basic implementations based on Coda Hale to collect the monitoring information. Micrometer Module This module provides basic implementations based on Micrometer to collect the monitoring information. It’s a dimensional-first metrics collection facade aiming to allow developers to time, count, and gauge their code with a vendor-neutral API.

A producer creates a payload and packages it in a message. It then sends the message to some message bus which delivers it to a consumer. The consumer unpacks the message, extracts the payload, and does something with it. Implementing this concept, though, is far from simple and straightforward. A robust solution needs to consider multiple functional and non-functional requirements. Such as message types and their respective routing patterns message buses metadata correlation serialization error handling transactions …​ Messages Message Routing Advanced Messaging Related

Below are the characteristics that every message has. All messages are uniquely identifiable. All messages are immutable. Updating a message mandates creating a new message based on the previous one, with extra information added. Immutability guarantees that messages are safe to use in a multi-threaded and distributed environment. In Axon Framework, a message is an immutable, serializable Java object implementing the Message interface. Figure 1.

A MessageDecorator abstract object allows for building more complex messages by wrapping existing message types. Avoid using generic messages directly. Use higher-level abstractions such as Command Messages, Query Messages, or Event Messages instead. Application developers don’t need to work directly with generic messages. The framework provides convenient higher-level abstractions for specific message types. It can also automatically construct the respective messages from domain-level objects, extract the payload of messages, and convert it to such domain-level objects. That said, understanding the generic messaging design and object structure can significantly help during debugging or building custom extensions.

Both Axon Synapse and Axon Server are standalone Java executables. Therefore, you need a development environment that supports Java and Maven to accomplish the steps in this guide. The \"AxonIQ Quick Start Toolkit\" package is available at https://download.axoniq.io/quickstart/AxonQuickStart.zip. The zip file contains the Axon Server (Standard Edition) and a sample Giftcard application, which you can use as an example application. Move the AxonQuickStart.zip to your preferred location and unzip the file. The first step is to get the Axon Server up and running since it’s the central point of communication in this example. To run the Axon Server, open a terminal window and cd to the folder where you unzipped the Quick Start file and execute the following command $ java -jar AxonServer/axonserver-{VERSION}.jar If your system can correctly execute JAR files, you should see the following status message on the command terminal. Figure 1. A screenshot of successfully started Axon Server Now you can visit the Axon Server’s Dashboard running on port 8024. It should look like the screenshot below. Figure 2. A screenshot of Axon Server’s Dashboard Click on the \"Overview\" tab on the left side to see a list of applications connected to your Axon Server instance. Figure 3. A screenshot of Axon Server’s overview page You only have the Axon Server running right now. Before you can run the Giftcard demo application, you need to build it. Use your preferred IDE or build tool to do so. Then execute the JAR file in a new terminal window. $ java -jar ./giftcard-demo-{VERSION}.jar --server.port=8081 In the command above, you’re telling the Giftcard app to use port 8081. Otherwise, it would bind to its default port (8080) which would conflict with Axon Synapse. You should see the following status message on the command terminal if the application starts correctly. Figure 4. A screenshot of successfully started Giftcard application Now that the Giftcard app is running, look again at the Axon Server’s Dashboard on port 8024. Figure 5. A screenshot of Axon Server’s overview page You can see that the Giftcard app has successfully connected to Axon Server. The final step is to download and install Axon Synapse. The Axon Synapse is available for download at https://download.axoniq.io/axonserver/axon-synapse.zip. The zip file contains the Axon Synapse as an executable JAR file. Move the JAR file to your preferred location. To run the Axon Synapse, open a terminal window, and cd to the folder where you moved the JAR file, and execute the JAR file. $ java -jar axon-synapse.jar You should see the following status message on the command terminal. Figure 6. A screenshot of successfully started Synapse application Now that you have Axon Synapse running, take one final look at the Axon Server’s Dashboard on port 8024. Figure 7. A screenshot of Axon Server’s overview page Now you have two applications running and connected to Axon Server: the Giftcard app and Axon Synapse. As previously mentioned, Axon Synapse runs on port 8080, so you can open a browser window to port 8080 to view the admin pages for Axon Synapse. Figure 8.

In this one, you’ll listen to messages from Axon Synapse. Again the three message types you can listen for are commands, queries, and events. To accomplish the steps in this guide, you need to download and install Axon Synapse, Axon Server, and the Giftcard demo application. Before you continue, please complete the steps detailed on the Installation page. Additionally, you need to download and install Postman. Go to Postman’s download page for detailed instructions. When you send messages to Axon Synapse, you send HTTP requests. To receive messages, Axon Synapse sends HTTP requests to your application. You may create such an application in any language. From Axon Synapse’s perspective, all that matters is that it can receive an HTTP request and process the message in the payload. For the purposes of this example, you’ll simulate your application by using Postman’s mock server feature. A command message is a request to perform a specific operation. Axon Synapse sends such messages via regular HTTP requests. Select Mock Servers in Postman’s sidebar, then select +. Figure 1. A screenshot of the first step of creating the command handling mock in the Postman Next, give it a name. You can leave default values in other options. Figure 2. A screenshot of the second step of creating the command handling mock in the Postman The new mock server is ready and waiting for incoming messages. Figure 3. A screenshot of the command handling mock in the Postman You must inform Axon Synapse what commands it should send to the application (the mock server in this case). Sending a registration request to Axon Synapse, as demonstrated below, is one way to do it. (1) (2) (3) POST http://localhost:8080/v1/contexts/default/handlers/commands Content-Type: application/json { \"names\": [ \"io.axoniq.demo.giftcard.api.IssueCardCommand\" (4) ], \"endpoint\": \"https://cb5b8a7d-d2d1-4583-a6bc-31c70e9d0593.mock.pstmn.io/gift-cards\", (5) \"endpointType\": \"http-raw\", (6) \"clientId\": \"Postman\", (7) \"componentName\": \"Giftcard\" (8) } 1 POST - indicates a POST request 2 http://localhost:8080 - the instance of Axon Synapse 3 v1/contexts/default/handlers/commands - registering a command handler 4 io.axoniq.demo.giftcard.api.IssueCardCommand - the command name 5 The command handler endpoint, in this example the Postman mock 6 The command handler endpoint type (http-raw means the payload is in the request’s body) 7 The unique identifier of the command handling application instance 8 The application of the application component Alternatively, you can use Axon Synapse’s UI to register the handler. Figure 4. A screenshot of registering the command handling mock in the Synapse UI If you configured the mock server correctly, there are now two command handlers in the system for the IssueCardCommand message. There is one in the Giftcard demo app and the Postman mock server you created. As new command messages of type IssueCardCommand arrive, they’re load-balanced between the two handlers. Go to the admin page for the Giftcard demo app and issue several new gift cards. Doing so creates and sends several IssueCardCommand command messages. At least some of them should go to Postman mock server. Once it receives such a command, you should see the content of the command and its meta-data, as on the screen below. Figure 5. A screenshot of a command captured by the Postman mock A query message is a request for information and so the handler must respond. Responding to a query message received from Axon Synapse is nothing more than replying to the HTTP request. You’ll use a Postman mock server again to simulate the behavior of an HTTP application. Select Mock Servers in Postman’s sidebar, then select +. Figure 6. A screenshot of the first step of creating the query handling mock in the Postman For the Response Body, you can use the template sown below. (1) (2) http-based-gift-card (3) 155 (4) 155 (5) 1 The response with list of gift cards 2 The first gift card 3 The id property 4 The initialValue property 5 The remainingValue property Proceed to the next step and give the mock a name. Figure 7. A screenshot of the second step of creating the query handling mock in the Postman Finally, you can listen to requests: Figure 8. A screenshot of the query handling mock in the Postman Go to the Collections tab and add headers to the response: AxonIQ-PayloadType: java.util.ArrayList Figure 9. A screenshot of the header view for query handling mock in the Postman You need to register the query handler with Axon Synapse as you did with the command handlers. The code below shows an example of doing so via the HTTP API. (1) (2) (3) POST http://localhost:8080/v1/contexts/default/handlers/queries Content-Type: application/json { \"names\": [ \"io.axoniq.demo.giftcard.api.FetchCardSummariesQuery\" (4) ], \"endpoint\": \"https://ac365f15-964b-4083-af93-1536f297fd7e.mock.pstmn.io/list-gift-cards/\", (5) \"endpointType\": \"http-raw\", (6) \"clientId\": \"Postman\", (7) \"componentName\": \"Giftcard\" (8) } 1 POST - indicates a POST request 2 http://localhost:8080 - the instance of Axon Synapse 3 v1/contexts/default/handlers/queries - creating a query handler 4 io.axoniq.demo.giftcard.api.FetchCardSummariesQuery - the query name 5 The query handler endpoint, in this example the Postman mock 6 The query handler endpoint type (http-raw means the payload is in the request’s body) 7 The unique identifier of the command handling application instance 8 The application of the application component Alternatively, you can use Axon Synapse’s UI to register the handler. Figure 10. A screenshot of registering the query handling mock in the Synapse UI Again, if you configured everything correctly, there are two query handlers for the FetchCardSummariesQuery - the one from the Giftcard demo app and the one from Postman’s mock server. Therefore, routing a query to the mock server may take several tries. You can test the query handler using the Giftcard demo app or Synapse HTTP query. Figure 11. A screenshot of a query result returned by the Postman mock in the Giftcard demo application UI Axon Synapse can send events to your application through HTTP requests, one by one, ordered by the sequence index. Create a new Mock Server in the Postman. Figure 12. A screenshot of the first step of creating the event handling mock in the Postman Figure 13. A screenshot of the second step of creating the event handling mock in the Postman Figure 14. A screenshot of the event handling mock in the Postman As with the other message types, you must register the event handler in Axon Synapse. Below is an example of the HTTP API approach. (1) (2) (3) POST http://localhost:8080/v1/contexts/default/handlers/events Content-Type: application/json { \"names\": [ \"io.axoniq.demo.giftcard.api.CardIssuedEvent\" (4) ], \"endpoint\": \"https://1d5cae3d-b328-4565-a36b-2d4a49de79de.mock.pstmn.io/card-issued\", (5) \"endpointType\": \"http-raw\", (6) \"clientId\": \"Postman\", (7) \"componentName\": \"Giftcard\" (8) } 1 POST - indicates a POST request 2 http://localhost:8080 - the instance of Axon Synapse 3 v1/contexts/default/handlers/events - creating an event handler 4 io.axoniq.demo.giftcard.api.CardIssuedEvent - the event type 5 The event handler endpoint, in this example the Postman mock 6 The event handler endpoint type (http-raw means the payload is in the request’s body) 7 The unique identifier of the event-handling application instance 8 The application of the application component Similarly to the earlier examples, you can use Synapse UI.

(1) (2) (3) (4) POST http://localhost:8080/v1/contexts/default/commands/io.axoniq.demo.giftcard.api.IssueCardCommand Content-Type: application/xml (5) (6) sample-card-6 (7) 55 (8) 1 POST - indicates a POST request 2 http://localhost:8080 - the instance of Axon Synapse 3 /v1/contexts/default/commands/ - sending a command 4 io.axoniq.demo.giftcard.api.IssueCardCommand - the command name 5 The command payload is in XML format 6 The command payload type (the same as the command name in this case) 7 The value of the id field 8 The value of the amount field The screenshot below shows how you can configure this request in Postman: Figure 2. A screenshot of the Postman UI After sending the request, return back to the admin page for the Giftcard demo app to see that the application issued a new gift card (with a balance of 55$). Figure 3. A screenshot of the Giftcard demo application UI You’ve just accomplished all the steps to send a command using an ordinary HTTP POST request to Axon Synapse. Axon Synapse (in turn) relayed the message to Axon Server, which gave the command message to its appropriate command handler. To experiment with sending a query over HTTP, list the gift cards you’ve created in the previous section. Read the listing below to see the HTTP POST request that Axon Synapse expects.

If access control is on, all the APIs that work on Synapse configuration expect clients to provide either a valid username and password combination or a valid token. A valid username/password combination is such that exists in Axon Server so it can verify the user has the correct roles for the request. Same for the token, it must exist in Axon Server with the required role. The required roles for the specific request types are: GET ADMIN@_admin, VIEW_CONFIGURATION@_admin (to get information from any context), ADMIN@context, USE_CONTEXT@context (to get information from a specific context) other ADMIN@_admin, ADMIN@context If you are using Axon Synapse in combination with Axon Server Standard edition the token must be the token specified in the Axon Server axoniq.axonserver.accesscontrol.token property for the GET operations, and the axoniq.axonserver.accesscontrol.admin-token property for the other requests. When a client sends a request to Synapse, it needs to provide a token to authenticate itself. The client must provide this token through the X-API-KEY header. The token must be valid in Axon Server, for an application to execute the request type in the specified context. If you are using Axon Synapse in combination with Axon Server Standard edition the token must be the token specified in the Axon Server axoniq.axonserver.accesscontrol.token property. When you register a request handler in Synapse, you can specify two types of tokens: client token server token The client token is the token that Synapse passes to the request handler. This way you can protect the request handler from illegal access. Axon Synapse passes the client token to the request handler as a Bearer token in the Authentication header. Axon Server verifies the server token on requests to register the handler. It needs to be a valid application token, with a role that allows registering that type of handler. For instance, to register a command handler, you need the token of an application to contain one of the following roles in Axon Server: SUBSCRIBE_COMMAND_HANDLER, WRITE, or USE_CONTEXT. If you are using Axon Synapse in combination with Axon Server Standard edition the token must be the token specified in the Axon Server axoniq.axonserver.accesscontrol.token property.","title":"Access Control","component":"synapse_ref","version":"v0.8","name":"access-control","url":"/synapse_ref/v0.8/access-control.html","titles":[{"text":"Access to the Axon Synapse API","hash":"_access_to_the_axon_synapse_api","id":1},{"text":"Sending messages","hash":"_sending_messages","id":2},{"text":"Receiving messages","hash":"_receiving_messages","id":3}]},"65":{"id":65,"text":"","title":"Aggregates","component":"synapse_ref","version":"v0.8","name":"aggregates","url":"/synapse_ref/v0.8/aggregates.html","titles":[]},"66":{"id":66,"text":"While these configuration options are still valid, please migrate to the new ones specified below.

The zip file contains Axon Synapse as an executable JAR file. Move the JAR file to your preferred location. Synapse reads configuration from the axonsynapse.properties file in the startup directory. You can also provide properties as parameters for the Java process, or as environment variables. The default HTTP port for Synapse is 8080. You can customize this by setting the server.port property. For Synapse to work it’s important that it can connect to Axon Server. To specify the location of the Axon Server nodes, specify the property synapse.server-list. This is a comma separated list of host names and optional port numbers. For example, to use 3 axon server nodes: synapse.server-list=axonserver1,axonserver2,axonserver3 For example, an axon server node using a custom gRPC port (not 8124): synapse.server-list=axonserver:7124 If you configure Axon Server to use transport layer security (TLS) for the gRPC communication, you need to perform additional steps to configure your installation. In this case, set the property synapse.use-tls to true. If Axon Server requires authentication, you need to specify a token that Synapse uses to connect to Axon Server for its internal tasks (like retrieving the existing contexts). Create the synapse.auth.token property. This token should have an ADMIN or VIEW_CONFIGURATION role to get all contexts from Axon Server, or it can have roles for specific contexts to only get those contexts. Please refer to the Configuration section for more information.

This page explains how the HA features in Synapse work. To see how to configure them, refer to HA Configuration. For using HA, you need to have selected AxonServer as a means of storing your Synapse configuration. Refer to Storage on how to do this. Whilst it’s possible to simply run multiple independent Synapse instances without shared configuration, this is highly discouraged and generally regarded as a bad idea. Using HA in Synapse does provide you with the following: Tolerate individual Synapse instances to go down for maintenance or crash Provide a way for the different handler types to balance themselves and be re-assigned when a Synapse instance goes down. Synapse handles the different handler types in different ways: Each Synapse instance registers all configured command handlers with AxonServer. AxonServer then makes sure to send the commands to the correct handler instance via the Synapse instance used to register the handler. To prevent duplication of events as far as possible, Synapse instances cooperate to register event handlers only from one Synapse instance. This allows your client application to receive events from only one Synapse instance, as long as the topology doesn’t change. When changing synapse instances, you may see slight duplication of events delivered. This is normal and unavoidable. When topology changes (for example when a Synapse instance crashes or a new one appears), handlers are re-assigned to available Synapse instances according to a consistent hashing algorithm. This makes sure that if a Synapse instance goes down, other instances pick up the now unassigned event handlers. As with Command Handlers, each Synapse instance registers all configured query handlers with AxonServer. Again, AxonServer then makes sure to send the queries to the correct client application. To be fully high-available, it’s not enough to have Synapse set to HA. One should take the following aspects into consideration. Synapse instances (and other client applications directly connecting to AxonServer, like AxonFramework applications) should have the addresses of all primary AxonServer nodes in the cluster configured. This allows them to reconnect if an AxonServer node were to go down. Using the AxonServer as storage implementation and enabling HA allows you to tolerate synapse nodes going down and the remaining ones taking over. If you use Synapse to publish events, commands or queries, make sure that your client applications know all available Synapse instances and can retry if one should go down. Alternatively, add a reverse proxy with multiple upstream destinations for the publish endpoints. Further, have your client applications run in a highly available manner. If Synapse is available but your client application goes down, you didn’t win much in regards to availability. Further, since registered handlers in Synapse only can have one configured URL, make sure to place a reverse proxy with multiple upstream destinations in between Synapse and the client applications it’s calling. Thereby, synapse can retry calling endpoints if one of the instances of your client application were to go down.","title":"High Availability","component":"synapse_ref","version":"v0.8","name":"index","url":"/synapse_ref/v0.8/ha/index.html","titles":[{"text":"Prerequisites","hash":"_prerequisites","id":1},{"text":"What HA in synapse covers","hash":"_what_ha_in_synapse_covers","id":2},{"text":"Command handlers","hash":"_command_handlers","id":3},{"text":"Event handlers","hash":"_event_handlers","id":4},{"text":"Query handlers","hash":"_query_handlers","id":5},{"text":"Infrastructure","hash":"_infrastructure","id":6},{"text":"Axon server","hash":"_axon_server","id":7},{"text":"Synapse","hash":"_synapse","id":8},{"text":"Client applications","hash":"_client_applications","id":9}]},"82":{"id":82,"text":"","title":"","component":"synapse_ref","version":"v0.8","name":"client-message","url":"/synapse_ref/v0.8/openapi/client-message.html","titles":[]},"83":{"id":83,"text":"","title":"","component":"synapse_ref","version":"v0.8","name":"client-raw","url":"/synapse_ref/v0.8/openapi/client-raw.html","titles":[]},"84":{"id":84,"text":"Axon Synapse communicates with third-party applications via HTTP (a.k.a.

When switching between storage types, you lose the stored configuration. Synapse allows you to select the used storage implementation by configuring the property synapse.storage.type. The only valid values are axonserver and local. When using local storage (synapse.storage.type=local), Synapse stores all its configuration in its own local embedded database. Your specific Synapse instance utilizes these settings, which are unique for your instance. When using AxonServer as the storage implementation (synapse.storage.type=axonserver), Synapse uses a context in the specified AxonServer to store its configuration. It also uses the local embedded database to keep a representation of the current state. Using AxonServer storage does require you to have multiple contexts in your AxonServer, which in turn requires you to have valid license for AxonServer. Many synapse instances can share the configuration stored when using AxonServer as the storage implementation. Refer to High Availability to find out more about this feature. When connecting to AxonServer, Synapse may need to authenticate itself. To allow for a fine-grained Access Control List, configure a separate token used for connecting to the storage context. Use the property synapse.storage.token. Further, you may need to change the used context for storing Synapse configuration in. Use the property: synapse.storage.context. To see all supported configuration options, refer to Configuration It currently isn’t possible to switch between storage types whilst keeping your Synapse data. To achieve reproducible and easier-to-migrate setups, consider setting up the configuration in an automated way. This allows you, should you decide to switch storage types, to wipe the Synapse storage, change the used implementation and then use your automation to re-create the configuration. If you want to change the used implementation, you have to remove the Synapse database file (axon-synapse.mv.db by default) before changing the settings.
