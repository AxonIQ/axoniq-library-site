= Local links

This folder contains local installations of the documentation on specific branches.
You can run `sh update.sh` in this folder to clone or update them. You can switch branches by editing the file.

This allows for commits over all repositories at once, for structural changes or updates.
In addition, it will allow you to test changes out easily.

Before doing this, you should create a Github access token and add the following line to your `~/.git-credentials` file:

[source]

https://GITHUB_USERNAME:GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com

After updating, you can build the documentation by running `npx antora playbook-dev.yaml` in the root of the repository.
