= Local links

This folder is used during development and should contain symlinks to the local git clones of the related projects:

 - UI
 - Axon Framework
 - Axon Server
 - Giftcard demo
 - ...

For example if you checkout this repo into `/home/docs` and you have Axon Framework in `/home/AxonFramework`, you should create a symlink `/home/docs/localLinks/AxonFramework` that points to `/home/AxonFramework`.

See the `content -> sources` section of link:../playbook-dev.yaml[`playbook-dev.yaml`] file for which local sources are configured.

NOTE: Do not commit the symlinks you create in this folder to the upstream repo. They only make sense in local environments. Different people have those pointing to different folders
