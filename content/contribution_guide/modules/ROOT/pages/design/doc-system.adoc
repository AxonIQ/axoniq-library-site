= Documentation System

AxonIQ Library closely follows the https://documentation.divio.com/[de-facto standard documentation system], where all materials fall into one of the following groups: tutorials, how-to guides, technical references, and explanations. Please take some time to learn about the system if this is the first time you have encountered it. The site linked above provides a concise yet complete description and some examples.

== Four types of information

As you can see in the above image, there are four types of information: tutorials, how-to guides, documentation, and explanations. They represent different purposes and require different approaches to their creation.

The following table _(copied from the website linked above)_ summarizes how those differ.

== Applying the system in AxonIQ Library

The AxonIQ Library contains three of the four content types: tutorials, how-to guides, and documentation. The fourth type, explanations, is embedded withtin the other three. 


=== Tutorials

These materials take the reader by the hand and help them complete a project of some kind. *The goal is to show a beginner they can achieve something with it*. It doesn't have too detailed or exhaustive. There may be more (and even better) ways to achieve the same result.

The following are some examples of content that you should write as tutorials.

Building a Giftcard application:: Walks the reader through creating a somewhat simple application.
Axon Synapse quick start guide:: Walks the reader through the basics of using Axon Synapse
Axon Server installation guide:: Basic instructions on how to run Axon Server on-premises, in Docker, and on the Cloud.

=== How-to guides

These are recipes and directions to achieve a specific end. *The goal is to have a working, complete, and correct solution at the end*. Those are different from tutorials and must be distinct. A tutorial is what a beginner needs to know. *A how-to guide answers a question only a user with some experience could formulate*.

The following are some examples of content that you should write as how-to guides.

How to integrate Axon Framework with <something else>:: Detailed instructions from zero to a working integration.
How to run Axon Server on AWS:: Detailed instructions on how to run Axon Server on AWS infrastructure.
AxonIQ Cloud How-Tos:: A collection of mini how-to materials explaining how to achieve certain goals _(transfer an account, configure segments, ...)_ via the UI.

=== Documentation

These are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. *The goal is to understand how something works, what problem it solves, the design considerations, etc*. Naturally, documentation must use examples to demonstrate intended usage. However, it's not a tutorial or a how-to guide.

The following are examples of content that you should write as documentation.

Axon Framework documentation:: Detailed information on the internals of the framework, its design considerations, and intended usage.
Axon Server documentation:: Detailed information on the APIs _(gRPC, REST, ...)_ used to communicate with the server.
Axon Synapse documentation:: Detailed information on the endpoints, their purpose, supported encodings and payload types, required vs. optional request parameters and headers, etc.
