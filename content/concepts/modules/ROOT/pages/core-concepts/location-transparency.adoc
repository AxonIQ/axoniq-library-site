== Overview

The biggest benefit of using explicit Messages, is that components that interact with each other don't need to know the location of their counterpart.
In fact, in most cases, the sending component isn't even interested in the actual destination of a message.
We call this "Location Transparency."

Axon takes location transparency further than placing services behind a logical URL.
In Axon, a component that sends a message does not need to specify a destination for that message.
Messages are routed based on their stereotype \(Command, Query or Event\) and the type of payload that they carry.
Axon uses an application's capabilities to find a suitable destination for a message automatically.

A system built up of Location Transparent components makes that system highly adaptable.
For example, a monolithic system built out of well-separated components that communicate solely using Commands, Events and Queries, can be easily split into separately deployed units, without any impact on functionality.

This makes Axon highly suitable for Microservices environments. Logic can be easily moved from, to, and in-between deployed components without impact on the functional aspects of the system as a whole. The location of logic can then be primarily decided upon based on the non-functional requirements of each individual component of that system. Components that have clearly different performance characteristics, or components that require a different release cycle, could, for example, be split out of a monolithic application to reduce the impact of changes to this component.
