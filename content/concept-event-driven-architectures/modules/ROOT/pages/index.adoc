= What are Event-Driven Architectures?

== TL;DR
Event-Driven Architectures (EDA) are software systems where services communicate by producing and responding to events.
So, what’s an "event", anyway? An *event* represents something important within a software system that *has* happened.
In Event-Driven Architectures, services react to these events asynchronously. This design enables systems to be more scalable, flexible, and maintainable by decoupling services and allowing them to operate independently yet cohesively.

== More details on Event-Driven Architectures

Event-Driven Architectures revolve around the concept of events as the primary means of communication between services. In this context, an event is a record of something that has happened within the system, such as, for example, a user creating a new account on a website, an order being placed, or a payment being processed. Unlike traditional architectures where components and services might directly call each other, EDA allows services to publish events and allows other services to subscribe to events.

At the heart of EDA are *event producers* and *event consumers*. Event producers are the services that perform operations resulting in state changes and generate those events. For example, when a user updates their profile information, a "UserService" can produce the "UserUpdated" event reflecting this change. On the other hand, event consumers are the services that listen for specific events and react accordingly. Therefore, an "EmailService" might consume the "UserUpdated" event to send a confirmation email to the user.

The communication between producers and consumers is facilitated by an *event bus*, which acts as a central hub for event propagation. The event bus ensures that events are reliably delivered from producers to the appropriate consumers without the services needing to be aware of each other. This decoupling allows services to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently. Tools like *Axon Server* can serve as the event bus, providing efficient routing and delivery of events across the system.

An event typically consists of three elements: the *event type*, the *payload*, and optional *metadata*. The event type describes what occurred, such as "OrderPlaced" or "PaymentProcessed," providing a clear indication of the action or state change that happened. The payload contains the data associated with the event, offering context that consumers need to perform their tasks. Metadata may include additional information like timestamps, source identifiers, or transaction IDs, aiding in tracking and auditing processes.

One of the significant advantages of EDA is the creation of *loosely coupled services*. Since services communicate through events rather than direct calls, they do not need to know about each other's existence or implementation details. This separation reduces dependencies, making the system more robust to changes. Developers can modify or replace a service without impacting others, facilitating easier maintenance and faster development cycles.

*Asynchronous communication* is another key benefit. Services in an EDA system do not wait for immediate responses when they emit events. Instead, they continue their operations, and consumers process events at their own pace. This non-blocking communication enhances system performance and responsiveness, especially under high-load conditions, as services can handle multiple events concurrently without bottlenecks.

EDA also enhances *scalability*. Individual services can be scaled horizontally—adding more instances to handle increased load—without affecting the rest of the system. This targeted scaling is more efficient and cost-effective than scaling entire monolithic applications. As demand fluctuates, resources can be allocated where they are most needed.

*Resilience* is built into the architecture. If a service fails, the rest of the system can continue functioning. Since services are independent, a failure in one does not cascade to others. This isolation minimizes downtime and allows for smoother recovery processes. Services can be restarted or replaced without bringing down the entire system.
