The Axon Server dashboard runs on port 8024 by default, while the gRPC port for Axon Framework clients is 8124. You can tweak this by editing the properties:

[source,properties]
----
server.port=8024              # Dashboard port
axoniq.axonserver.port=8124   # gRPC port for Axon Framework clients
----

A full list of properties can be found in the xref:axon-server-reference::axon-server/administration/admin-configuration/configuration.adoc[configuration reference].

[NOTE]
If you want your Axon Server to be accessible from other machines, you need to add additional settings so machines know
where to find each other. For more information, see the xref:axon-server-installation::extra/hosts-and-connections.adoc[hosts and connections].
