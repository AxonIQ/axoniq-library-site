Now that you have Axon Server running, you can start using it with your Axon Framework applications.
If you run on the same computer and the default ports, your Axon Framework application should be able to connect to Axon Server without any additional configuration.

If you modified the port or hostname, you need to configure Axon Framework to connect to Axon Server.
For Spring Boot, you can do this by adding the following properties to your `application.properties` file:

[source,properties]
----
axon.axonserver.servers=YOUR_HOST:YOUR_PORT
