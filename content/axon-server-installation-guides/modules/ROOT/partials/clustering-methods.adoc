There are various ways to set up a cluster of Axon Server nodes:

. *Auto-clustering*: By defining which node is in charge of forming the cluster, it will automatically form
. *Axon Server Dashboard*: By going into the Axon Server dashboard after Step 6, you can initialize the cluster manually
. *AxonIQ Console*: it's possible to add your Enterprise license to AxonIQ Console. This will automatically form a cluster of nodes.
. *Cluster Template*: By defining a xref:axon-server-reference:ROOT:axon-server/administration/admin-configuration/cluster-template.adoc[cluster template], you can automatically form a cluster. While beyond the scope of this guide, you can find more information in the reference guide.
