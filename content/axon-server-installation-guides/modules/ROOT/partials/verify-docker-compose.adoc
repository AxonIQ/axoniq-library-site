Make sure you have Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine.
You can verify this by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker --version
docker compose --version
----

You should see an output like:

[source,text]
----
Docker version 24.0.2, build cb74dfc
Docker Compose version v2.19.1
----

[NOTE]
====
Older versions of docker uses a separate executable, called `docker-compose`. If you have an older version, you can use the `docker-compose` command instead of `docker compose`. You can check this by running `docker-compose --version`.

If you cannot execute the commands successfully, we recommend following the link:https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[docker setup guide].
