AxonIQ provides ready to use Axon Server images at `docker.axoniq.io/axoniq/axonserver` (https://hub.docker.com/r/axoniq/axonserver[Docker Hub]).
In this guide, we will use the `latest-jdk-17` image.
For a guide on all images, and how to make your own, see xref:extra/choosing-docker-image.adoc[choosing and building your own Docker image].
If you choose to do this, replace the image in the commands below.
