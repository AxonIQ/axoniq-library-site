By connecting your Axon Server to AxonIQ Console, you will be able to:

* Automatic initialization and clustering of Axon Server instances
* Create multiple contexts in Axon Server to organize your applications
* Inspect the status of your Axon Server through AxonIQ Console
* Get deep insights into the status and performance of your applications when also connected to AxonIQ Console
* Create multiple users and Access token in Axon Server

In contrast, without connecting to AxonIQ Console, you can:

* Only have one context in Axon Server
* Only have one user and one access key in Axon Server
