Now that you have your Axon Servers running, you can start using it with your Axon Framework applications.

Your Axon Framework applications should list all nodes of Axon Server in their properties file,
so that if one node goes down, the application can still connect to the other nodes initially.

[source,properties]
----
axon.axonserver.servers=axon-server-1:8124,axon-server-2:8124,axon-server-3:8124
----

Please replace the `axon-server-1`, `axon-server-2`, and `axon-server-3` with the hostnames of your Axon Server nodes.
And replace `8124` with the gRPC port of your Axon Server nodes.
