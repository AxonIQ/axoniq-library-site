Depending on your cloud environment or machine configuration, you might need to open the ports in the firewall.
Please refer to the documentation of your cloud provider or operating system for more information.

The following ports need to be accessible:

- The dashboard port (default: 8024) from where you want to access the Axon Server dashboard.
- The gRPC port for Axon Framework clients (default: 8124) from where your Axon Framework applications connect to Axon Server.
- The gRPC port for cluster communication (default: 8224) for communication between Axon Server nodes in a cluster. This port does not need to be accessible from the outside.

During operations of Axon Server, you might want to connect to individual nodes in the cluster.
We discourage any form of load-balancing for any port of Axon Server, as it might lead to unexpected behavior.
