*Requirements:*
Before we can install Axon Server, we need to make sure that your system has the required dependencies.
The following command will install the required dependencies.

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt install ca-certificates lsb-release curl
----

*Signing key:*
All artifacts are signed with a private key, that the package manager will verify upon installation.
It does this for you, so you can be sure the software you install is trusted.
The following command imports our public key for this verification.

[source,bash]
----
sudo curl https://pkg.axoniq.io/axoniq.pub -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/axoniq.asc
----

*Repository:*
Next, we have to add the repository that houses our artifacts.

[source,bash]
----
echo "deb [arch=all signed-by=/etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/axoniq.asc] https://pkg.axoniq.io/apt $(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/axoniq.list > /dev/null
----

*Install:*
We are ready for the installation!

[source,bash]
----
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install axonserver
----
