= Ubuntu

You can install Axon Server through the APT package manager integrated into Ubuntu.
Using this method will make it simple to update using commands as well.

[NOTE]
====
The package currently only supports Ubuntu 22 (Jammy) and 24 (Focal).
More distributions will be supported in the future.

== Step 1: Pick a node

As we are installing a multi-node cluster, you need to pick one of the nodes to be the first node.
Please follow the steps completely for this node first, and then repeat step 2 to 7 for the other nodes.

== Step 2: Installation

include::partial$ubuntu-install-steps.adoc[]

== Step 3: Configure

Axon Server runs with adequate defaults, where it will assume the hostname of the machine it is running on and run on the default ports.
However, you can customize it by editing the `/etc/axonserver/axonserver.properties` file that was just installed on your machine.

include::partial$step-configure.adoc[]

[NOTE]
If you want your Axon Server to be accessible from other machines, you might need to add additional settings so machines know where to find each other.
For more information, see the xref:axon-server-installation::extra/hosts-and-connections.adoc[hosts and connections].

== Step 4: AxonIQ Console

The AxonIQ Professional edition of Axon Server will retrieve its license from AxonIQ Console using an access token.
In addition, it will register its connection information so that other nodes can automatically find the cluster.

=== Obtaining the AxonIQ Console access token

include::partial$obtain-console-access-token.adoc[]

=== Setting the access token

Now you have the access token, you can set it in the `/etc/axonserver/axonserver.properties` file.
Add the following line to the file:

[source,properties]
----
axoniq.console.authentication=<your-access-token>
----


== Step 5: Configure ports

include::partial$step-configure-ports.adoc[]

== Step 6: Run Axon Server

You can now start Axon Server!
You can use Systemd if your system uses it:

[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl start axonserver
----

Or, alternatively, you can run it manually:

[source,bash]
----
sudo -i -u axonserver
cd /var/lib/axonserver/
sh start-axonserver.sh
----

== Step 7: Verify installation

Once the Axon Server instance has booted up, you should be able to access the dashboard by navigating to `http://HOSTNAME:8024` in your browser, provided the firewall allows it.
You can also verify that Axon Server started up correctly by checking AxonIQ console.
You can see an example of a healthy cluster in the image below.

If this is only the first node you are connecting, you will only see one node in the cluster.

== Step 8: Repeat for remaining nodes

To connect the other nodes to the cluster, repeat steps 2 to 6 for each node until all nodes are correctly up and running.
