=  Axon Server Analyticsâ€”Quick Start

pass:[<!-- vale AxonIQ.Headings = NO -->]

Axon Server version `2025.2.0-EAP2 contains a preview of Axon Server Analytics, which provides advanced analytics capabilities for your Axon applications. To use the analytics features, you need to set up an Axon Server cluster with an analytics node.

This guide outlines the installation process for an Axon Server cluster with an Axon Server analytics node, covering two primary scenarios:

1. Creating a new cluster with generated demo data
2. Setting up a new cluster with an existing event store

== Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites in place:

- Anthropic API key
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine

== Scenario 1: Creating a Cluster and Generating Demo Data

This scenario is ideal for users who want to quickly set up an Axon Server cluster with an Analytics Node in a Docker environment and want to use generated demo data for testing and exploration.

=== Prerequisites

- Access to the Axon Server Docker image (latest version supporting Analytics Node)

=== Steps

1. *Prepare your environment*. Ensure you have a suitable directory for your new Axon Server cluster.
2.. *Extract the zip file download from the trial page in the target directory*.
2. *Replace <your_anthropic_api_key> with your actual key in the docker-compose.yml file*.
4. *Start the Axon Server Docker containers for your Axon Server cluster*.
+
[source,text]
docker compose up -d

5. *Verify the containers*. Check the Axon Server console or logs to ensure that the Axon Server is started correctly. To log on to the Axon Server console, use the URL http://localhost:8024.
6. *Generate demo data*. Use the URL http://localhost:8888 to open the event generator.

== Scenario 2: Setting Up a New Cluster with an Existing Event Store

This scenario is for users who have an existing Axon Server event store (for example, from a previous installation or a migrated system) and want to set up a new Axon Server cluster including an Analytics Node in a Docker environment.

=== Prerequisites

- An existing Axon Server event store (data files)
- Access to the Axon Server Docker image (latest version supporting Analytics Node)

=== Steps

1. *Set up the environment*. Follow steps 1-3 from the previous section.
2. *Create a directory for the event store data*:
+
[source,text]
----
mkdir -p node1/events/default
----

3. *Place your existing event store data into the node1/events/default directory*. This consists of the `*.events`, `*.nindex`, and `global-index-*.xref` files from the existing event store.
4. *Start the Axon Server Docker containers*.
+
[source,text]
----
docker compose up -d axonserver-1 axonserver-2
----

5. *Verify the container*. Check the Axon Server console or logs to ensure that the Axon Server is started correctly. To log on to the Axon Server console, use the URL http://localhost:8024.

6. *Verify the second container*. Check the Axon Server console or logs to ensure that the Axon Server is started correctly. To log on to the Axon Server console, use the URL http://localhost:8025.

The overview page on the second node shows the two nodes connected. The menu on the left shows fewer options as this node is an analytics node. The Event store menu has the analytics option.
