= Ubuntu

This guide will walk you through the steps to run Axon Server Enterprise as a cluster of multiple nodes, while using the
APT package manager built into Ubuntu.

[NOTE]
====
The package currently only supports Ubuntu 22 (Jammy) and 24 (Focal).
More distributions will be supported in the future.
====

== Step 1: Pick a node

As we are installing a multi-node cluster, you need to pick one of the nodes to be the first node.
Please follow the steps completely for this node first, and then repeat step 2 to 7 for the other nodes.

== Step 2: Installation

include::partial$ubuntu-install-steps.adoc[]

== Step 3: Configure

Axon Server runs with adequate defaults, where it will assume the hostname of the machine it is running on and run on the default ports.
However, you can customize it by editing the `/etc/axonserver/axonserver.properties` file that was just installed on your machine.

include::partial$step-configure.adoc[]

[NOTE]
If you want your Axon Server to be accessible from other machines, you might need to add additional settings so machines know where to find each other.
For more information, see the xref:axon-server-installation::extra/hosts-and-connections.adoc[hosts and connections].


== Step 4: Define clustering

====
Auto-clustering::
+
--
Setting up auto-clustering is straightforward. You define the node allowed to be the first to form the cluster,
by defining it in the properties of all nodes. The first node will then create the cluster, and the other
nodes will join it automatically.

Add the following properties to the `axonserver.properties` file of all nodes:

[source,properties]
----
axoniq.axonserver.autocluster.first=axonserver-1:8224   # The hostname and port of the first node
axoniq.axonserver.autocluster.contexts=_admin,default   # The contexts that are automatically created
----

--
Axon Server Dashboard::
+
--

When accessing the Axon Server dashboard for the first time, you will be prompted to complete installation.

On the first node, choose "Start node and initialize multi-node cluster", and click "Complete".

On the other nodes, choose "Join existing cluster", fill in the host address and port of the first node, and click "Complete".

Repeating this for all nodes will form a cluster.

--

AxonIQ Console::
+
--
Please ask your AxonIQ representative to add your Enterprise license to AxonIQ Console. Once you have done that, you can acquire the access token from the console and add it to the properties file of all nodes, as such:

[source,properties]
----
axoniq.console.authentication=YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
----

== Step 5: Configure ports

include::partial$step-configure-ports.adoc[]

== Step 6: Run Axon Server

You can now start Axon Server!
You can use Systemd if your system uses it:

[source,bash]
----
sudo systemctl start axonserver
----

Or, alternatively, you can run it manually:

[source,bash]
----
sudo -i -u axonserver
cd /var/lib/axonserver/
sh start-axonserver.sh
----

== Step 7: Verify installation

Once the Axon Server instance has booted up, you should be able to access the dashboard by navigating to `http://HOSTNAME:8024` in your browser, provided the firewall allows it.
You can also verify that Axon Server started up correctly by checking AxonIQ console.
You can see an example of a healthy cluster in the image below.

If this is only the first node you are connecting, you will only see one node in the cluster.

== Step 8: Repeat for remaining nodes

To connect the other nodes to the cluster, repeat steps 2 to 6 for each node until all nodes are correctly up and running.
