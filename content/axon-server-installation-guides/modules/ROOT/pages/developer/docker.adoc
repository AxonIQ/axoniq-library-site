= Docker

Docker has become a standard method of running software on your computer.
Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to run applications in isolated environments.
This makes it easy to run Axon Server on any machine that supports Docker.

[NOTE]
====
Want to use Docker Compose? Use the xref:developer/docker-compose.adoc[Docker Compose guide] instead.
====

== Step 1: Verify installation

Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine.
You can verify this by running the following command:

[source,bash]
----
docker --version
----

You should see an output like: `Docker version 24.0.2, build cb74dfc`.

If you cannot execute this command successfully, we recommend following the link:https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/[docker setup guide].

== Step 2: AxonIQ Console (optional)

By connecting your Axon Server to AxonIQ Console you can unlock additional functionality.

== Step 3: Choose your image (Optional)

== Step 4: Run

It's now time to run your docker image.
The command depends a little bit on whether you choose to use AxonIQ Console or not (from Step 2).

With AxonIQ Console::

Please replace the `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` text with the access key acquired in Step 2.

[source,bash]
----
docker run \
    --name axon-server \
    -e axoniq_console_authentication="YOUR_CONSOLE_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
    -p 8024:8024 -p 8124:8124 -p 8224:8224 \
    axoniq/axonserver:latest-jdk-17-nonroot
----
--


Without AxonIQ Console::

--
[source,bash]
----
docker run \
    --name axon-server \
    -p 8024:8024 -p 8124:8124 -p 8224:8224 \
    axoniq/axonserver:latest-jdk-17-nonroot
----
--
====

[NOTE]
====
In the commands, you can tweak the exposed ports of the Docker image, so the Axon Server dashboard runs on another port.
For example, you can replace `-p 8024:8024` with `-p 8025:8024` to get access the dashboard on `localhost:8025`.
====



== Step 5: Initialize

When you go to the dashboard for the first time, you will be prompted to initialize Axon Server.

Please choose the `Start standalone node` edition and click `Complete`. You are now ready to use Axon Server.

[NOTE]
====
To initialize Axon Server as standalone node without a UI action, you can add  `-e AXONIQ_AXONSERVER_STANDALONE=true`
to the Docker command.
