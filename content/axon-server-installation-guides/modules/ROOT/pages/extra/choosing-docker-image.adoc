= Choosing Docker Image


AxonIQ provides ready-to-use https://hub.docker.com/r/axoniq/axonserver[Axon Server images].
These images are all based on https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-temurin[Eclipse Temurin], which means they include a (limited) shell that allows you to connect "into" the running image and perform some commands.

There are two variants available:

* The regular images, for example, tagged `2024.2.4` or `2024.2.4-jdk-17` run Axon Server as the `root` user inside the container.
This image is particularly useful for running in Docker Desktop, as it will not have any trouble creating files and directories.
* The `nonroot` images, for example, tagged `2024.2.4-nonroot` or `2024.2.4-jdk-17-nonroot` runs Axon Server as the `axonserver` user.
This image is more secure  in Kubernetes and OpenShift clusters.

[NOTE]
====
When using a `nonroot` image, you have to run the container with `user` and `group` id `1001`. In Kubernetes, this would mean adding a link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/[security context] to the pod definition:


[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
spec:
  serviceName: axonserver
  replicas: 1
  template:
    spec:
      securityContext:
        runAsUser: 1001
        runAsGroup: 1001
        fsGroup: 1001
      containers:
      - name: axonserver
        image: axoniq/axonserver:latest-jdk-17-nonroot
        # Rest of file omitted for brevity
----

Doing this will ensure that any mounted volumes will be writable by the user running Axon Server.
====

== Exported volumes

The pre-built images export the following volumes:

=== `/axonserver/config`

This is where you can add configuration files, such as an additional `axonserver.properties` and the license file.
However, you can also opt to use, for instance, Kubernetes, or Docker-compose secrets.
Note that Axon Server assumes it can write to the directory configured with `axoniq.axonserver.enterprise.licenseDirectory`, so you don't have to put the license on all nodes.

=== `/axonserver/data`

This is where the ControlDB, the PID file, and a copy of the application logs are written to.

=== `/axonserver/events`

Contains the event store, with a single directory per context. Be sure to size this volume correctly, as it will grow over time.

=== `/axonserver/log`

Contains the replication logs. This needs to be big enough to hold the data of the past hour to ensure Axon Server can recover from failures correctly.

=== `/axonserver/plugins`

You can place plugins in this volume. The plugins are loaded at startup and can be used to extend Axon Server with additional functionality.

== Building your own image [[build-image]]

You can, of course, build your own container per your own requirements.
A starter Dockerfile is included below which can be tailored as per your requirements.

The starter file helps create the image in multiple stages:

* The image will be based on a compact image from Googleâ€™s `distroless` base images at the gcr.io repository, in this case `gcr.io/distroless/java:11`.
* The first stage creates the directories that will become our volumes.
This step cannot be performed in the Distroless image, because that image does not provide a shell.
* The second stage begins by copying the home directory with its volume mount points, carefully keeping ownership set to the new user.
* The last steps copy the executable jar named axonserver.jar and a common set of properties.
It marks the volume mounting points and exposed ports and finally specifies the command to start Axon Server.

[source,docker]
----
FROM busybox as source

RUN mkdir -p /axonserver/config /axonserver/data /axonserver/events /axonserver/log /axonserver/exts

FROM gcr.io/distroless/java:11

COPY --from=source /axonserver /axonserver
COPY axonserver.jar axonserver.properties /axonserver/

WORKDIR /axonserver

VOLUME [ "/axonserver/config", "/axonserver/data", "/axonserver/events", "/axonserver/log", "/axonserver/exts", "/axonserver/plugins"  ]
EXPOSE 8024/tcp 8124/tcp 8224/tcp

ENTRYPOINT [ "java", "-jar", "./axonserver.jar" ]

----

If you want to build a "nonroot" version, you need to adjust this as follows:

[source,docker]
----
FROM busybox as source
RUN addgroup -S -g 1001 axonserver \
    && adduser -S -u 1001 -G axonserver -h /axonserver -D axonserver \
    && mkdir -p /axonserver/config /axonserver/data /axonserver/events /axonserver/log /axonserver/exts \
    && chown -R axonserver:axonserver /axonserver

FROM gcr.io/distroless/java:11

COPY --from=source /etc/passwd /etc/group /etc/
COPY --from=source --chown=axonserver /axonserver /axonserver

COPY --chown=axonserver axonserver.jar axonserver.properties /axonserver/

USER axonserver
WORKDIR /axonserver

VOLUME [ "/axonserver/config", "/axonserver/data", "/axonserver/events", "/axonserver/log", "/axonserver/exts", "/axonserver/plugins" ]
EXPOSE 8024/tcp 8124/tcp 8224/tcp

ENTRYPOINT [ "java", "-jar", "./axonserver.jar" ]

----

As you can see, this will start by creating the user `axonserver` belonging to a group with the same name.
When copying the directory, we now have to ensure that ownership transfers correctly and specify the user to run as, but otherwise it looks pretty similar.

For the common properties (`axonserver.properties`), the minimum set can be added to ensure that the volumes get mounted and logs generated.
Again these can be tailored as per the deployment requirements.

[source,properties]
----
axoniq.axonserver.event.storage=./events
axoniq.axonserver.snapshot.storage=./events
axoniq.axonserver.replication.log-storage-folder=./log

axoniq.axonserver.enterprise.licenseDirectory=./config
#axoniq.axonserver.accesscontrol.systemtokenfile=./config/axonserver.token

axoniq.axonserver.controldb-path=./data
axoniq.axonserver.pid-file-location=./data

logging.file=./data/axonserver.log
logging.file.max-history=10
logging.file.max-size=10MB

----

Place the Dockerfile, the Axon Server jar file (`axonserver.jar`), the Axon Server client jar file (`axonserver-cli.jar`) and the `axonserver.properties` in the current directory.
Then build the image using the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ docker build --tag my-repository/axonserver:my-axon-server-tag.

----

This completes the construction of the Docker image.
The image us built and saved your local repository.
However, if you want to share it with others, you need to push it to a repository that others can access.

== Running the image

Whether you built your own image or are using the AxonIQ provided images, you can now use this image in the installation guides where appropriate.
Make sure to replace the image name with the one you built, or the one you want to use from AxonIQ, in the relevant guide's commands and files.
