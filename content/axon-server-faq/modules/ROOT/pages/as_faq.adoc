== Q: So, what exactly is Axon Server? 

Answer: Axon Server is a zero-configuration message router and event store. If you’re a Java developer, it works well with  Axon Framework-based applications. However, if you’re using Python, Node.js, C# (or any other major programming language), it provides out-of-the-box message routing and event storage.

== Q: What are some of the main features of Axon Server?

Answer: Here’s a short list of features of the Axon Server:

* Out of the box, zero configuration Message Routing

* Event sourcing capabilities with an infinitely scalable Event Store

* Real-time observability and insights into the messages exchanged between your applications
* Role-based Access Control for both users and applications 
* Easy to scale-out and configure within a clustered environment

== Q: How does Axon Server work as an Event Store? 
Answer: Unlike other messaging solutions like Apache Kafka, which only natively provides message routing, Axon Server works as both a message router and an Event Store. As a dedicated Event Store, Axon Server is designed to store events to enable your microservices applications to be event-sourced. This ensures that events are stored durably and indefinitely and provides superior scalability and throughput without complex database tuning.

== Q: Since RDBMs have problems with scalability, let's discuss scale. Can Axon Server handle large-scale event storage needs? 
Answer:  Yes, Axon Server is built to handle large-scale event storage needs with its infinitely scalable event store, which can manage large volumes of events without performance degradation.
