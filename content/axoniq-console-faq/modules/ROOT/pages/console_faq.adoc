== Q: What's the cost of the AxonIQ Console, and is there a free option? 

Answer: Yes! The AxonIQ Console is free (no credit card required), and you are limited to a maximum of 100 handlers for your environment, however, we also have “team” and  “enterprise” plans to easily allow you to support more handlers. See the https://www.axoniq.io/pricing/axoniq-console[AxonIQ Console pricing page] for more information.


== Q: How can I create an account to get started?

== Q: How do I connect my Applications to the AxonIQ Console?

Answer: In order to connect your  apps to the AxonIQ Console, click on the *Applications* tab. If you’re using the AxonIQ Console for the first time, then no applications will be displayed. However, you will be presented with installation instructions that will allow you to configure your Plain Java projects or Spring Boot applications so that they can be discovered by the AxonIQ Console.

You can also find instructions on how to install a Demo Application that has everything already configured and will allow you to see activity instantly in the AxonIQ Console.

After your first application has been configured properly, the Applications tab will display all discovered applications.

== Q:  How can I see the flow of messages for my applications within the AxonIQ Console?

Answer: One of the most requested features within the AxonIQ Console is the ability to see the flow of messages between applications.

After clicking the Message Flow tab, you’ll see a layout graph of your environment's publishers and consumers (dispatchers and handlers). Each “dot” in the graph represents an application, and the arrow shows the source and destination of the message. The color of the arrow is significant and represents the following:
* Blue arrow: Command Messages
* Green arrow: Query Messages
* Red arrow: Event Messages
* Yellow arrow: Deadline Messages

The arrow's thickness represents the amount of messages sent to the Handler.

== Q: I am paying with my credit card monthly. Can I stop my monthly subscription at any time?

Answer: Yes, no problem! Please note that subscriptions are paid ahead monthly. Therefore, if you choose to stop, you still have access to the AxonIQ Console until the end of the billing cycle.


== Q: We are already using monitoring tooling such as ELK or Splunk. What is the added value of using another tool, the AxonIQ Console?
Answer: Tools such as the ELK Stack and Splunk are great for monitoring the status of your network infrastructure. However, the AxonIQ Console was explicitly designed for developers to analyze and manage your Axon Framework applications more intricately. The AxonIQ Console also enables developers to view the real-time activity of a cluster of Axon Server nodes within a single interface. Therefore, the AxonIQ Console can provide insights into the overall health and status of your applications and services in ways that the ELK Stack or Splunk were not designed for.


== Q: What is a Handler, and what does “Handler Usage” mean? 
Answer: The Axon Framework enables developers to create microservice-based applications using the publish and subscribe pattern. We support three Message types so you can build evolutionary applications. For all three types of messages, you can create a Handler within an application to handle a specific message (or a group of messages, if you prefer). 

So, how does the Handler Usage count work?

Each method annotated with a handler annotation counts as a handler. If you have multiple instances of an application, that will be summed. For example, if you have an application with 20 handlers, and run 4 instances, that will count as 80 handlers.

When determining the number of handlers you want in your Workspace, it’s important to also account for the extra handlers that will be needed  during deployments. You can view an overview of detailed handler usage on the Subscription page.

== Q: What happens if I exceed my Handler Usage Quota? 
Answer: Your subscription determines how many handlers we accept data from. We check periodically to see if you stay within this amount and block handlers until the amount is within your subscription again.

Before we block handlers, there is a grace period to allow for the purchase of extra handlers before we stop showing metrics.  grace period of a week. After the grace period, we will only allow the original amount in your subscription. You will be notified via logs in your application, e-mail, and the AxonIQ Console Web Interface.


== Q: Where can I manage my Access Tokens?
