== Q: How do I connect my Applications to the AxonIQ Console?

Answer: In order to connect your  apps to the AxonIQ Console, click on the *Applications* tab. If you’re using the AxonIQ Console for the first time, then no applications will be displayed. However, you will be presented with installation instructions that will allow you to configure your Plain Java projects or Spring Boot applications so that they can be discovered by the AxonIQ Console.

== Q:  How can I see the flow of messages for my applications within the AxonIQ Console?

Answer: One of the most requested features within the AxonIQ Console is the ability to see the flow of messages between applications.

After clicking the Message Flow tab, you’ll see a layout graph of your environment's publishers and consumers (dispatchers and handlers). Each “dot” in the graph represents an application, and the arrow shows the source and destination of the message. The color of the arrow is significant and represents the following:
* Blue arrow: Command Messages
* Green arrow: Query Messages
* Red arrow: Event Messages
* Yellow arrow: Deadline Messages

The arrow's thickness represents the amount of messages sent to the Handler.

== Q: I am paying with my credit card monthly. Can I stop my monthly subscription at any time?

Answer: Yes, no problem! Please note that subscriptions are paid ahead monthly. Therefore, if you choose to stop, you still have access to the AxonIQ Console until the end of the billing cycle.
