= Documentation System

AxonIQ Library closely follows the https://documentation.divio.com/[de-facto standard documentation system], where all materials fall into one of the following groups: tutorials, how-to guides, technical references, and explanations. Please take some time to learn about the system if this is the first time you have encountered it. The site linked above provides a concise yet complete description and some examples.

== There isn't one thing called documentation

.The documentation types quadrant
image::doc-system.png[]

As you can see in the above image, there are four types of documentation materials: tutorials, how-to guides, technical references, and explanations. They represent four different purposes or functions and require four different approaches to their creation.

The following table _(copied from the website linked above)_ summarizes how those differ.

== Applying the system in AxonIQ Library

When writing documentation, always consider *who's the reader* and *what's the goal*. Don't try to produce "one documentation serves them all" solutions. Even when documenting the same product, split the information into different learning materials to help the readers focus on their goals. If you feel the reader would benefit from more information that doesn't fit the given documentation format, provide links to a relevant place in a different learning material.


=== Tutorials

These materials take the reader by the hand and help them complete a project of some kind. *The goal is to show a beginner they can achieve something with it*. It doesn't have too detailed or exhaustive. There may be more (and even better) ways to achieve the same result.

The following are some examples of content that you should write as tutorials.

Building a Giftcard application:: Walks the reader through creating a somewhat simple application.
Axon Synapse quick start guide:: Walks the reader through the basics of using Axon Synapse
Axon Server installation guide:: Basic instructions on how to run Axon Server on-premises, in Docker, and on the Cloud.

=== How-to guides

These are recipes and directions to achieve a specific end. *The goal is to have a working, complete, and correct solution at the end*. Those are different from tutorials and must be distinct. A tutorial is what a beginner needs to know. *A how-to guide answers a question only a user with some experience could formulate*.

The following are some examples of content that you should write as how-to guides.

How to integrate Axon Framework with <something else>:: Detailed instructions from zero to a working integration.
How to run Axon Server on AWS:: Detailed instructions on how to run Axon Server on AWS infrastructure.
AxonIQ Cloud How-Tos:: A collection of mini how-to materials explaining how to achieve certain goals _(transfer an account, configure segments, ...)_ via the UI.

=== References

These are technical descriptions of the machinery and how to operate it. *The goal is to understand how something works, what problem it solves, the design considerations, etc*. Naturally, a reference must use some examples to demonstrate intended usage. However, it's not a tutorial or a how-to guide.

The following are some examples of content that you should write as references.

Axon Framework reference documentation:: Detailed information on the internals of the framework, its design considerations, and intended usage.
Axon Server reference documentation:: Detailed information on the APIs _(gRPC, REST, ...)_ used to communicate with the server.
Axon Synapse reference documentation:: Detailed information on the endpoints, their purpose, supported encodings and payload types, required vs. optional request parameters and headers, etc.


=== Explanations

These provide explanations and clarify and illuminate a particular topic. *The goal is to provide background and broader context*.

The following are some examples of contents that you should write as explanations.

Software development concepts:: An overview of the essential software development concepts the products depend upon. It highlights the most important, relevant, and not-relevant parts.
[.no-prose-lint]
What is Axon:: Explanation of the term, how it differs from the many "Axon-" products, and when it's correct to use it.
